<div class="cont"><p class="text-justify">Pan leaves are cultivated to eat. Get leafy tree trees It has multiple uses. Panic juice helps digestion, increases taste and acts as stomach disorder. Scientists believe that the original birthplace of the dawn in Malaysia is damp. In Bangladesh, Khulna, Barisal, Patuakhali and Rajshahi districts are widely cultivated. However, the cultivation of paan is also being spread in other districts. Generally, different types of drinks are found to be seen. Insert it in or include Banglaapana, Mithapan, Chalpan, Lilapana, Camphiapana, Planting etc.<br><br> Shady summer heads get better in damp environments. In summer, the size of the pan is small but the taste is good. In the rainy season the yield of paan is good. However, it is damaging to excessive rainfall and water standing in the trees. Its cultivation extends through artificial environment in the districts of North Bengal of Bangladesh. Generally, surrounded by vegetation or jute, etc., surrounded by a shady atmosphere. The shady surroundings around this shade are called 'bor' or 'beroz' in the current language. The burrows are made in such a way that the light required for the trees does not obstruct the wind. The wells are rich in water and there is a system of drainage, sowing loamers, duhs and etel soils are suitable for cultivation. Organic fertilizers and silt soil can be cultivated as needed in red loin soil. In the hilly area soil saplings are planted. The holes are 25/30 cm deep and 30 cm wide. In every hole 400-800 grams of wood ash dung manure and compost fertilizers are applied.
    The seed of the plant is cut into small pieces to make saplings. <br><br>Every plant should have 25-30 cm long and it has 3-5 knob. Usually two gates are placed under the ground and one or more knob is placed on the ground. For preparation of saplings, the old and healthy and sickle trees of at least two years of age are selected. Right after the start of monsoon is the time to plant sapling. Irrigation in the soil is required before transplantation. In areas where there is a high prevalence of 'dying' diseases, it is possible to combine copper sulphate with irrigated water as antidote in all areas.
    In the pane fields, weeds have to be especially careful about it. Generally, the plant is not allowed to grow 1-1.5 meters in length. Because collecting a lot of trees from trees becomes a problem, and with this, the life energy of plants is also reduced. That is why the tree is sometimes refreshing in the depression process when it is high. After the height of the specified height, it is not necessary to bind the tree with the propulsion. At the bottom of the tree, the planting of the leaves finally descends to the ground. In such a situation, the soil is buried in the adjoining area without leaving the growing part of the tree. The tree of the process is refreshed and it has to be done at least once a year. Irrigation does not require rainy season. But in the winter season, irrigation is done once after 6/7 days. In Bangladesh, get 30-35 million pounds per hectare.
